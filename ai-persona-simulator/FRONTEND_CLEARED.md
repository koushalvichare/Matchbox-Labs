# Frontend Cleared - Ready for New Development

## What was removed:
- All React components and pages
- All frontend assets and styles
- All React and UI framework dependencies
- Frontend build tools (Vite, Tailwind, PostCSS, etc.)
- Configuration files for frontend tools

## What was preserved:
- ✅ `src/services/geminiService.js` - Your AI service integration
- ✅ `.env` file - Environment variables
- ✅ Documentation files (README.md, guides, etc.)
- ✅ Essential AI dependencies (`@google/generative-ai`, `openai`)

## Current structure:
```
ai-persona-simulator/
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── package.json (cleaned)
├── src/
│   └── services/
│       └── geminiService.js
├── public/ (empty, ready for new assets)
└── documentation files
```

## Ready for:
You can now build your new frontend using any framework:
- React
- Vue
- Angular
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Next.js
- Or any other frontend technology

The AI services are still available and ready to be integrated with your new frontend.
